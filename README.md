AutoDesk Fusion 360 plans for a bandsaw sled/jig to cut round logs.

# Background

Try cutting a round log on a bandsaw (or any other power tool) and you're taking a risk that the blade bites and twists/spins the wood. This can damage the workpiece, tool, or - most importantly - you!

This is a jig in which you would secure a round log so that it cannot rotate while you make your first cut. Once you have a first cut, you can remove the log from the jig and use a regular bandsaw fence, or you can continue to make additional passes with the jig. 

# Notes

This is my first project with AutoDesk Fusion 360. This isn't a great plan (and currently still a work in process).
